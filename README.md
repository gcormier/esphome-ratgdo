# ratgdo for ESPHome

This is a port of the ratgdo software for the v2 board to ESPHome.


If you can, [Visit the github.io page to purchase boards](https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/#order). In case you are in one of the countries that Paul cannot ship to, below is a minimal schematic that allows you to use this project to communicate with the garage opener:

## Moving from stock ratgdo

If you have not used the stock ratgdo firmware, and are starting with a fresh install of the ESPHome based firmware, [skip these steps](#fresh-install-when-the-stock-ratgdo-firmware-was-not-used-before).

- Use the [`Logs & Console`](https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/flash.html) to view and make note of the current rolling code
- Flash the new ESPHome based firmware using the [Web Installer](https://esphome-ratgdo.github.io/esphome-ratgdo/)
- Use the `number` entity in Home Assistant or the built-in ESPHome web-server to set the rolling code.

## Fresh install when the stock ratgdo firmware was not used before

- Flash the new ESPHome based firmware using the [Web Installer](https://ratgdo.github.io/esphome-ratgdo/)

## First use after adding to Home Assistant

The ESPHome firmware will allow you to open the door to any position after calibration. To calibrate the door, open and close it once without stopping.

## Updating from versions older than 2023.07.07

When updating from older versions, save the rolling counter value and restore it via the number entity after flashing the new firmware. If you forget to save the code, check the Home Assistant history.
